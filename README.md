# AlwaysTooLate.GameCooker
AlwaysTooLate's game cooking utility. Provides per-platform build settings and more.

# Installation

Before installing this module, be sure to have installed these:

- [AlwaysTooLate.Core](https://github.com/AlwaysTooLate/AlwaysTooLate.Core)

Open your target project in Unity and use the Unity Package Manager (`Window` -> `Package Manager` -> `+` -> `Add package from git URL`) and paste the following URL:
https://github.com/AlwaysTooLate/AlwaysTooLate.Logging.git

# Basic Usage

In order to open the GameCooker's window, select `AlwaysTooLate` -> `GameCooker` -> `Open`. From there, you can browse, create, edit or delete Presets and Targets.

Presents are used for grouping Targets. Targets are be used for configuring the build's target platform, type (Debug or Release) and define symbols, plus some additional settings.

After selecting a Target from the window, you can start building by selecting `AlwaysTooLate` -> `GameCooker` -> `Build` or pressing `Alt`+`B`. Alternatively, you may select the `Scripts only` build (`Alt`+`Shift`+`B`) - warning, it is not a working feature yet.
